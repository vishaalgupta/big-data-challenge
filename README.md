# big-data-challenge

# In the Level 1 folder, there are two notebooks. Each notebook takes a data file from Amazon and puts the data into a dataframe using PySpark. Then, that dataframe is seperated into smaller dataframe to match the schema found in the Resources file. The schema is created in a RDS database and then data in the notebook is uploaded into the corresponding tables in the RDS database.
